Modus Operandi, Inc.
: *Software Engineer III*
  __2012-Present__
  Work in a dynamic team as a full-stack developer for enterprise and government-funded research projects. The team utilizes the Agile software development process to effectively adapt to shifting project requirements. A number of projects involve helping clients solve big data problems within their organizations. This involves using a reasoner to make sense of their data and discover patterns in their stores such as Cassandra and Accumulo. 
  
  Took a lead development role on a large-scale workflow project involving collaboration with a number of performers located throughout the US. This required a continuous integration plan which employed the use of Vagrant, Packer, Stash, and Docker. A python script would kick off a chain of events resulting in the performers components being deployed to the clients host as a docker container, linked up with the other performers containers, resulting in a continuously integrated application usable by the client.

  Additionally, led the research and development of a project which performed skeletal analysis and gesture recognition on  video feeds. Gesture metadata, geospatial trending, and intelligence reports would be used to determine and notify users if actions of interest are occurring in the sensor feeds.
